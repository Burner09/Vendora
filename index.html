        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
          Vendora is an innovative e-commerce platform designed to serve as a
          one-stop hub for local businesses, including restaurants, retail
          stores, and service providers. Many small businesses struggle to
          create and maintain their own websites due to limited resources and
          technical expertise, leading to reduced visibility and missed growth
          opportunities. Our platform simplifies this process, allowing
          businesses to showcase their offerings while making it easy for
          consumers to find everything their community has to offer.

        <h3>Business Model</h3>
        <p>
          Vendora operates under a **New-Market Disruption** model, targeting
          local consumers and small businesses that lack an online presence. By
          providing a platform that empowers these businesses, Vendora creates a
          new market space where community engagement is prioritized,
          differentiating itself from larger competitors like Amazon.

          Vendora connects consumers to smaller local businesses, providing
          experiences that feel personalized. Competitors are larger-scale
          businesses that don't require Vendora's platform to find their target
          consumers.
