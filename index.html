        <h2>Overview??</h2>
        <p>
          Vendora is an innovative e-commerce platform designed to serve as a
          one-stop hub for local businesses, including restaurants, retail
          stores, and service providers. Many small businesses struggle to
          create and maintain their own websites due to limited resources and
          technical expertise, leading to reduced visibility and missed growth
          opportunities. Our platform simplifies this process, allowing
          businesses to showcase their offerings while making it easy for
          consumers to find everything their country has to offer.
